# protoc-gen-rn-grpc-js

A `protoc` plugin for generating developer friendly client stubs in the Javascript code of your React Native app. The job of these stubs is to communicate with the underlying native implementation of gRPC.

## Typescript support

Typescript definitions for gRPC client stubs can be included in the output, enabling complete type-safety in your code.
